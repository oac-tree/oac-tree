# Issues

* Handle termination in `ParallelSequence`.
* Properly handle reset: check also setup method to verify correct configuration of instructions (attributes).
* Exception safety is not everywhere managed as it should.
* Add unit tests.
* Investigate daemon procedures for data aggregation and summarizing (could be alternative to MARTe2)
